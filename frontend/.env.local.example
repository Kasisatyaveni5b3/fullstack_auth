# Frontend Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root (same directory as `package.json`) with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

This tells the frontend where the backend is running. On Windows, you can also set it via:

```powershell
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = "http://localhost:4000"
```
